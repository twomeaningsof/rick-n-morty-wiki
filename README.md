# Rick and Morty Wikipedia
It was high time to finally start honing my Typescript skills, get to know GraphQL, and build an app with the Next.js framework.
Having that tech stack I picked open-source API, to code the Wikipedia-like application of the Rick and Morty cartoon.

## Technologies
- TypeScript
- React
- Apollo GraphQL
- Next.js
- Tailwind

## Launch
The app is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed directly via [link](https://https://rick-and-morty-ir.netlify.app/).   

### Run locally
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` <br><br>
